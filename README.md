<h3>An FPS Game Demo Developed by Roman Gabriel (LonelyJenkins)</h3>
<p>This FPS was created to demonstrate a functional understanding of both the Unity Engine and the C# language.<br>
Within you will find examples of 2 Team Deathmatch variants and a Wave Survival Mode.<br>
All code and animations (EXCEPT FOR BOSS MONSTER ANIMATIONS) are original works of the developer (all animating was done within the Unity Engine). <br>
All sound effects, models, and textures are premade assets.</p>
<p>You can play the game (in its most recent state) in a supported browser <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/lonelyjenkins-fps-demo">here!</a></p>
